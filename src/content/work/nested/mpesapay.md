Mpesa Pay JavaScript SDK, is a Javascript sdk library that simplifies the integration of Mpesa payments into Node.js applications. Developed using TypeScript and leveraging the capabilities of Node.js, this SDK streamlines the process of incorporating secure and convenient Mpesa payments into your web applications.

To create the Mpesa Pay JavaScript SDK, I utilized the power and flexibility of TypeScript. By leveraging TypeScript's static typing and advanced features, I was able to build a robust and reliable library that ensures type safety and enhances the overall developer experience. TypeScript provides clear documentation, improved code navigation, and better error checking, allowing developers to seamlessly integrate the SDK into their projects.

Additionally, for the bundling and building process, I chose Parcel. Parcel is a fast and zero-configuration bundler that simplifies the development workflow. With Parcel, I could easily bundle and optimize the Mpesa Pay JavaScript SDK, ensuring efficient and performant code delivery to end-users.
