## Level-two heading

> Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.

This project represents a significant milestone in my journey as a web developer. With attention to detail and a passion for creating great user experiences, I designed and built verixr (the service) agency website from the ground up.

Using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, and MongoDB, I build a website that combined visual appeal with functionality. Leveraging Next.js' server-side rendering capabilities, I ensured fast loading times and optimized performance. Tailwind CSS empowered me to create responsive and visually stunning designs that adapted seamlessly to various devices. On the backend, Node.js handled the server-side logic, enabling efficient data handling and smooth functionality. MongoDB served as the database, offering a flexible and scalable solution for managing project data and client information.
